# THIS BOT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL ANYMORE DUE TO COBALT REMOVING API ACCESS WITHOUT A KEY. YOU CAN USE THE CODE IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN SELFHOSTED API.


# cobalt.tools [UNOFFICIAL]
A bot I made for fun that uses the cobalt.tools API, you can install it on your discord account and use it anywhere, anytime

The files are directly from the hosting and is what the bot runs on.
